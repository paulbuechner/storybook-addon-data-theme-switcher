## storybook-addon-data-theme-switcher@1.0.0

### Major Changes (**BREAKING**)

Preparations for storybook v9 have been made. Consult the updated documentation [`README`](https://github.com/paulbuechner/storybook-addon-data-theme-switcher/tree/main) for information on how to migrate to this version.

- Updated the addon to use `@storybook/icons` package to render the data theme switch icon, as it otherwise would become deprecated with the release of storybook v9.

- Migrated to new consolidated `initialGlobals` API to define and load the data-themes.
