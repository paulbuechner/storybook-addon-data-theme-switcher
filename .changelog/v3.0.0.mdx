## storybook-addon-data-theme-switcher@3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#375](https://github.com/paulbuechner/storybook-addon-data-theme-switcher/pull/375) [`19a1ba2`](https://github.com/paulbuechner/storybook-addon-data-theme-switcher/commit/19a1ba2eb1b73a5da73208aefb7d06fb3dfc6154) Thanks [@paulbuechner](https://github.com/paulbuechner)! - Update addon for storybook v10:
  - Drop support for Storybook v8.3, and v9 (requires Storybook v10).
  - As of v10 Storybook now requires addons to target [ESM only](https://storybook.js.org/docs/addons/addon-migration-guide#esm-only-builds).
    Therefore, this release targets ESM only and drops support for CommonJS.
  - Node requirements updated to Node 20.19 or higher.
